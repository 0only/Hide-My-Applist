        Although "It is incorrect to detect specific app's installation", yet not every app using root provides random packagename support. In this case, detected apps that use root (such as Fake Location and Storage Isolation) is equal to detected root itself.\n\nAt the same time, some "smart" apps use various loopholes to acquire your applist, so that it can draw a persona for you.\n\nThis module provides some methods to test whether you have already hided your applist nicely. Also, it can work as an Xposed module to hide some apps or reject applist requests to protect your privacy.

        Normal apps use some of API requests to acquire applist, but "bad" apps will use other methods (loopholes) to detect it. Attention, under global mode (Reject applist requests) if hide "intent query" there may be some problems with share, start browser, etc.
